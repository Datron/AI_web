The player is the programmer of the robot, who will have no direct influence on the game. Instead, the player must write the AI of the robot telling it how to behave and react on events occurring in the battle arena. So the name Robocode is a short for "Robot code".
The game is designed to help you learn Java, and have fun doing it. Robots are written in the JavaTM Programming Language, and the Robocode game can run on any operating system supported by the Java Platform, which includes all common operative systems like Windows, Mac OS X, Linux etc.
Robocode's battles take place in a battlefield, where small automated 6-wheeled robots fight it out until only one is left.</h3></p></div>
